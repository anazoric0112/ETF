Note: all of this can be changed in future

Naming conventions:
 * folder and file names are low capitalized and words are separated with underscore (_) 

CSS:
 * Modify all shared styles in shared_styles.css
 * If some style is specific to a certain page then create new css file having the same name as html page but with suffix _style.
 * It would be nice to have some convention around targeting elements that are being styled for example by providing absolute path to that element (it might be ugly though)
